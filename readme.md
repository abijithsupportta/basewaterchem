# Aqua Service Manager — Complete Project Documentation (Master Readme)

## 1) Project Identity
- Product: Aqua Service Manager
- Organization: Base Water Chemicals
- Domain: Water filter sales + service + AMC lifecycle management
- Primary Goal: Unified operational platform for service scheduling, invoice lifecycle, customer support, technician workflows, and admin control.

## 2) Executive Summary
Aqua Service Manager is a full-stack operational platform built on Next.js and Supabase. It supports customer onboarding, service request management, AMC contract execution, invoice generation, inventory tracking, notifications, branch and staff administration, and role-governed dashboards. The architecture follows a layered model with clear separation between presentation, domain intent, and infrastructure concerns.

## 3) Today’s Work Journey (Chronological)
- Fixed staff API relation ambiguity (`branches!staff_branch_id_fkey`) to resolve PostgREST embed errors.
- Converted credential email sends to non-blocking/background patterns to avoid 40s+ API wait times.
- Implemented staff deletion with reassignment of dependent records (services, invoices, expenses).
- Added superadmin-only resend credentials API and UI flows.
- Restricted staff module access to superadmin-only policies.
- Corrected role resolution strategy to prefer auth metadata role first.
- Updated sidebar logout behavior to redirect immediately to login.
- Implemented technician-specific dashboard view (today’s services, dues, stock status only).
- Optimized service completion flow (parallelized stock logs/AMC operations, background notifications).
- Fixed TypeScript and build issues in staff route/resend route and service completion page.
- Restricted invoice module access for technician role in both nav visibility and route-level guard.

## 4) Core Technology Stack
- Frontend Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- UI Runtime: React 19
- Language: TypeScript (strict)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + component primitives
- Data/Backend: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)
- Validation: Zod
- Forms: React Hook Form
- Notifications/Toasts: Sonner
- Charts/Visuals: Recharts
- PDF Generation: jsPDF + autotable
- Email: Nodemailer
- Icons: Lucide React
- Deployment model: Node runtime with Next.js server routes

## 5) High-Level Functional Scope
- Authenticated dashboards for operational roles.
- Customer registration, profile updates, service association.
- Service scheduling, assignment, progress transitions, completion accounting.
- AMC service cycles and recurring schedule creation.
- Invoice creation, status updates, and reporting views.
- Inventory-aware service part usage and stock transaction logging.
- Expense capture and day-book style daily tracking.
- Staff lifecycle management and role-aware access enforcement.
- Settings and branch management for organizational operations.

## 6) User Roles
- superadmin
- admin
- manager
- staff
- technician

## 7) Role Intent Model
- superadmin: highest privilege; sensitive actions (staff module management, deletion operations).
- admin: business ops role with elevated management visibility.
- manager: operational owner role with branch/day-to-day supervision.
- staff: execution + data entry oriented role.
- technician: field execution role with intentionally constrained access surfaces.

## 8) Security Model (Summary)
- Supabase Auth for identity sessions.
- Role derivation with metadata-first strategy to avoid stale lookup edge-cases.
- RLS enabled for sensitive tables (including email logs).
- Server-side role gates on APIs for privileged actions.
- UI-level role gates to remove unauthorized entry points.
- Service role key used only where elevated administrative operations are required.

## 9) Notable Security Controls
- Privileged endpoints verify role before mutating sensitive entities.
- Self-delete prevention for staff account deletion operations.
- Reassignment logic blocks delete when no safe reassignment target exists.
- Credential resend/update is superadmin-only and password validation constrained.
- Email failure logging for traceability and audit review.

## 10) Database-Related Operational Notes
- Staff table supports auth linkage and role identity mapping.
- Services table tracks assignment, creation actor, completion actor, and billing fields.
- AMC contracts track intervals, completion counts, and next-service chronology.
- Email delivery logs table captures type, payload, status, and error context.
- Inventory transactions are appended for service-related stock deductions.

## 11) API Surface Themes
- `/api/services` + related id routes for service lifecycle operations.
- `/api/staff` + `/api/staff/resend` for staff management and credential resend.
- `/api/invoices`, `/api/customers`, `/api/inventory/*`, `/api/expenses`, `/api/settings`.
- `/api/notify` and cron route for service reminders.

## 12) UI/UX Themes
- Dashboard-first navigation for operational flow.
- Role-tailored nav visibility to reduce accidental misuse.
- Completion forms with billing and parts accounting in one workflow.
- Modal + validation interactions for risky actions (delete/resend).
- Toast feedback for user-visible operation outcomes.

## 13) Service Completion Performance Improvements
- Eliminated long sequential waits by parallelizing independent async operations.
- Service record update remains blocking (critical transaction), while side-effects move non-blocking where safe.
- Stock logging operations now fan out in parallel rather than one-by-one.
- AMC follow-up operations now pre-fetched/parallelized where possible.
- Customer notifications are asynchronous and do not block UI completion success.

## 14) Known Operational Guardrails
- Keep service-role operations server-side only.
- Preserve role checks on both UI and API boundaries.
- Maintain schema/index hygiene for high-frequency status transitions.
- Ensure email delivery failures are logged, not silent.

## 15) Build/Quality Status Snapshot
- Next.js production build passes after latest fixes.
- TypeScript strict checks pass.
- Role-based invoice restriction updated for technicians.
- Main branch contains latest commits for performance + access control hardening.
